		<h3>Employment</h3>
			<div><h5 id="Employer">Online English Teacher</h5>
				<p>Since May of 2018, I've been a consultant for iTutor.com, an online platform for teaching English to students of all ages, mostly from China and Taiwan. (if you want to get political, we can argue about whether Taiwan is a part of China and should not be mentioned separately.) It's not been a bad gig, although I do wish more of my students would use their webcams because teaching to disembodied voices is frustrating.</p>

			<h5 id="Employer">International Institute of St. Louis</h5>
				<p>From May 2003 to February 2018, I was the Training Coordinator at the International Institute. What that means, primarily, is that I pretty much single-handedly ran a program to train refugees and immigrants to work as nursing assistants in long term care facilities. I recruited students, administered English entrance exams, enrolled students, maintained all records for the students and program, coordinated with state agencies to make sure our program met their requirements, and (last by not least) taught English to the students enrolled in the program. </p>
				<p> In addition to the nursing assistant program, I coordinated sewing and hotel housekeeping training programs and taught Job Readiness Training to newly-arrived refugees.</p>
				<p>But alas! Changes to federal immigration policies and funding began in 2017, as well as changes in other sources of funding for the training programs, so my position as Training Coordinator became insecure. I had been thinking about a career change anyway, because I wanted to do more teaching and less administrative work. I love to create things, as a teacher, a writer, and in many other ways, and my job had evolved into mostly pushing paper around -- figuratively, since most of the "paperwork" was done on the agency's database management system.</p>
			<h5 id="Employer">Washington University in St. Louis</h5>
				<p>From August 1999 to May 2003, I taught ESOL (English to Speakers of Other Languages) as an adjunct instructor at Wash U. I loved interacting with highly-talented students from many different countries, but adjunct instructoring is part-time, and I really wanted a full-time job.</p>
			<h5 id="Employer">St. Louis Community College</h5>
				<p>During that same time period (August 99 to May 03), I also was an adjunct ESOL instructor at St. Louis Community College. While at Wash U, most of my students were internationals, the majority of the community college students were "generation 1.5" immigrants (that means they immigrated to the U.S. as children.)</p>
			<h5 id="Employer">Jiangxi Normal University, Nanchang, China</h5>
				<p>Ni hao! (Hello, in Mandarin) My first English-teaching experience was in the People's Republic of China. Those five years, from 1992 to 1997, were probably the most influential years of my life, because they taught me to think globally.</p>
				<p>At the time, Nanchang was not one of more famous cities. In fact, some of the China guidebooks said, "Don't go there if you don't have to." It was hot and humid in the summer; cloudy, cold, and damp in the winter, rainy in spring, and actually pretty decent in the fall. But hey! I'm from St. Louis!</p> 
			<h5 id="Employer">And then...</h5>
				<p>My life before China is kind of a blur. After graduating from college in 1984, I tried out several jobs, trying to figure out what I wanted to be when I grew up.</p>
