			<h4>Online English Teacher; May 2018 - Present</h4>
				I am currently a consultant for iTutor.com, an online platform for teaching English to students of all ages, mostly from China and Taiwan. It's not been a bad gig, although teaching to disembodied voices (a lot of students choose not to use their webcams) can be a challenge. And working with frustrating, buggy teaching software is partly what has inspired me to learn coding!

			<h4>International Institute of St. Louis; May 2003 - February 2018</h4>
				For almost fifteen years, I was the Training Coordinator at the International Institute. For the most part, I single-handedly ran a program to train refugees and immigrants to work as nursing assistants in long term care facilities. Recruiting students, administering English entrance exams, enrolling students, maintaining student and program records, coordinating with state agencies, and teaching English to the students enrolled in the program were all part of the job. In addition, I coordinated sewing and hotel housekeeping training programs and taught Job Readiness classes to newly-arrived refugees.<br><br>

				Changes to federal immigration policies, as well as to federal and state programs, resulted in decreased funding, so my position as Training Coordinator became insecure. I had been thinking about a career change anyway -- because I wanted to do more teaching and less administrative work. I love to create things, as a teacher, a writer, and in many other ways, and my job had evolved into mostly pushing paper around -- figuratively, since most of the "paperwork" was done on the agency's database management system.<br>

		<div>	<h4>Washington University in St. Louis; August 1999 - May 2003</h4>
				I taught ESOL (English to Speakers of Other Languages) as an adjunct instructor at Wash U. I loved interacting with highly-talented students from many different countries, but adjunct instructoring is part-time, and I wanted a full-time job.<br>
		</div>

		<div>	<h4>St. Louis Community College; August 1999 - May 2003</h4>
				I also was an adjunct ESOL instructor at St. Louis Community College. At Wash U, most of my students were internationals, but the majority of the community college students were "generation 1.5" immigrants (that means they immigrated to the U.S. as children.)</br>
		</div>

		<div>	<h4>Jiangxi Normal University, Nanchang, China. August 1992 - June 1997</h4>
				My first English-teaching experience was in the People's Republic of China. This is where I learned to think globally. Some of my greatest accomplisments while there were organizing, and writing the exam for, an English "listen off" (listening comprehension competition); and seeing my sophomore English composition students achieve a high passing rate on the composition section of the national sophomore English exam.<br> 

		</div>

		<div>	<h4>And then...</h4>
				My life before China is kind of a blur. After graduating from college in 1984, I tried out several jobs, trying to figure out what I wanted to be when I grew up.<br>
